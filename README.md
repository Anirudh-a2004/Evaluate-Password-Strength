# Evaluate-Password-Strength

The goal is to identify best practices for creating strong passwords and understand how password complexity impacts security against common attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.

Tasks Performed

Created Multiple Passwords

  Generated several passwords with varying complexity and length.

  Examples include combinations of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

Tested Passwords

  Used an online password strength checker to evaluate each password.

  Recorded scores and feedback provided by the tool.

Analyzed Results

  Compared the strength scores and identified what made stronger passwords more secure.

  Observed how adding length, randomness, and symbols improved the score.

Learned Best Practices

  Noted key tips and guidelines for creating strong, secure passwords.

  Understood the balance between memorability and complexity.

Researched Common Attacks

  Studied methods like brute force and dictionary attacks.

  Analyzed how weak or predictable passwords are easily compromised.
  
Summarized Findings

  Documented how password complexity increases resistance to common attacks.

  Highlighted the importance of unique and unpredictable passwords.

Best practice

  Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

  Make passwords at least 12â€“16 characters long.

  Avoid using personal information or common words.

  Prefer passphrases (a combination of random words) for both strength and memorability.

  Regularly update passwords and avoid reusing them across accounts.

Consider using a password manager for secure storage.f the password strength checker is updated in the repo for reference.

 Summary
Attack Type	Description	Defense

Brute Force	Attacker tries every possible combination	Increase length and complexity

Dictionary Attack	Uses lists of common words or leaked passwords	Avoid real words or predictable patterns


Conclusion

Password complexity directly impacts the time and effort required to crack a password.
Stronger, longer, and more random passwords significantly reduce vulnerability to common password attacks.
